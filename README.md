  ## How Treiner came about

  1on1, small group technical training, team training, goalkeeper and striker training has been part of the private soccer
  coaching scene since players and parents started to identify that they needed more than the traditional club and/or school
  coaching. In a team environment if they wanted to reach their full potential and many players wanting to play at higher levels,
  there were alot of coaches and providers that took advantage of a lack of information publicly available. No comparison or rating
  system available to determine the most suitable coach for their needs.

  ## Product Description

  Two-sided marketplace for soccerers (soccer players) and coaches service providers to organize one-on-one, small group or
  team training sessions.
