 <h3>
    How do I contact a coach before making a booking?
 </h3>

    The selected coach can be contacted by clicking on their profile and the contact us option in the Help section on the webpage. Under Treiner's privacy policy, the coaches cannot directly contact the client and a coaches contact details cannot be shared with the client. All messages need to be communicated via Treiner.

 <h3>
    What if I don’t receive a response from the coach after submitting an enquiry?
</h3>
<p>
    If you don’t receive a response from the coach then you can contact us through the Help page by submitting a support ticket or sending a message through contact treiner. This will help us understand your problem and get back to you as soon as possible.

<h3>
    What is the pay rate for each session?
</h3>
<p>
    Every coach charges a different pay rate based on their experience, session type and location. Hence, it varies and can be discussed once a request for booking a session is made. While booking your session you will be asked what your budget is and this will help set the rate you offer to pay your coach. However, it depends on them if they accept the offered amount.
</p>

<h3>
    How can I check if the coach is available to take the session on the preferred date?
</h3>
<p>
    While making a request for a session you will be asked to enter the preferred date and time. If the coach is available the session will be confirmed by us and a payment will be required. If the coach is not available we will find you another coach in the same location who can take the session on the selected date and time.
